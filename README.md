# Proyecto-Shark-Limpieza:

## Pautas del Proyecto

1. Crear un repositorio nuevo
    Src, img, data
    Readme.md
2. Issue (Con nuestro link pegado de nuestro repositorio)
3. Limpieza:
    Borrar columnas solo si tienen más de un 80% de nulos.
    Resultado: al menos 6.000 filas
    (Limpieza) Mismo tipo de dato, duplicados, etc.
4. Presentación.


## Suggested Ways to Get Started

- Examine the data and try to understand what the fields mean before diving into data cleaning and manipulation methods.
- Break the project down into different steps - use the topics covered in the lessons to form a check list, add anything else you can think of that may be wrong with your data set, and then work through the check list.
- Use the tools in your tool kit - your knowledge of Python, data structures, Pandas, and data wrangling.
  Work through the lessons in class & ask questions when you need to! Think about adding relevant code to your project each night, instead of, you know... procrastinating.
- Commit early, commit often, don’t be afraid of doing something incorrectly because you can always roll back to a previous version.
- Consult documentation and resources provided to better understand the tools you are using and how to accomplish what you want.

## How to deliver the project

1. Create a new repo with the name `data-cleaning-pandas` on your github account.
   - Create a `README.md` file on repo root with project documentation. Make sure to include as much useful information as possible. Someone that finds the README.md should be able to fully get a gist of the project without browsing your files.
   - Include a `.gitignore`
   - At least 1 jupyter notebook is required
   - Including your functions in a `src.py` is very, very highly reccommended (maybe even mandatory, check with your instructors)
   - **DO NOT UPLOAD SHARKs ATTACK DATASET TO GITHUB**
2. Open an `Issue` on this repo and paste your own repo's link.
